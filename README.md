# DES103 Project - Treasure Guessing Game

## Overview

Developed a coins-on-a-chessboard game in Java, leveraging OOP principles and utilizing built-in components such as JFrame, JPanel, JLabel, and JButton.

The coins-on-a-chessboard game is a two-player strategy game played on an 8x8 chessboard, with each cell numbered from 0 to 63. Initially, every cell contains a coin facing either heads or tails at random. Before the game begins, both players discuss their strategy. The first player then receives a 'magic number' and must flip a specific number of coins on the board. Afterward, the second player's objective is to guess the magic number based on the resulting coin configuration.

The game consists of four levels: easy, normal, hard, and impossible, which differ in terms of the number of flipsâ€”64, 16, 8, and 1, respectively. The game also allows for setting a discussion time up to 10 minutes.
